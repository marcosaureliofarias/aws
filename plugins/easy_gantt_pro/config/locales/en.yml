          on time for the project to complete on due date. An activity on the critical
          path cannot be started until its predecessor activity is complete; if it
          is delayed for a day, the entire project will be delayed for a day unless
          the activity following the delayed activity is completed a day earlier.
          For proper function of a critical path, the project should have just 1 starting
          and 1 ending task and the tasks should be connected with relations.
