      workflow:
        body: 'Workflow defines the life cycle of tasks of different types (trackers).
          The lifecycle is defined by the statuses that can be used in the task. For
          example, task in tracker Chore is a simple type of work with just a couple
          of phases: New > In progress > Superior approval > Done. While work like
          Financial reporting may require more steps: New > Assigned > In progress
          > Superior approval > Correcting > Senior approval > Director approval >
          Board approval > Done. Workflow is therefore a combination of a tracker
          and statuses that can be used on it. When a new tracker is imported, it
          doesn''t have any statuses enabled yet, and vice versa.'
