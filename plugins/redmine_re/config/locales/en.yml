    the two columns of the approach.</p> <p>Tasks do not distinguish between who does
    what. Task closure means that your task has a well defined start and end point.
    A good starting point is something that happens in the user''s world, for instance
    that a client calls. A good end point is that nothing more can be done about the
    case right now - the user deserves a "coffee break". [Lauesen 2011, S. 34]</p>
